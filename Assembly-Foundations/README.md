# Assembly Foundations

This folder contains foundational ARMv7-A assembly programming projects.  
Each project focuses on building critical low-level skills, including:

- Basic register operations (MOV, ADD, SUB)
- Memory traversal using indirect addressing
- Conditional branching and loop control
- Stack management with PUSH and POP
- Logical operations (AND, ORR, EOR)
- CPSR flag manipulation for conditional execution
- System call handling for terminal output and program termination

##  Purpose

The projects in `Assembly-Foundations/` represent the first stage in developing a strong understanding of low-level system programming.  
They form the base for future growth into embedded systems, reverse engineering, and cybersecurity work.
